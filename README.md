**Cross Chat** is a Spigot plugin that will make cross-chatting between Discord and Minecraft servers simple and easy.
The plugin is written using Java and Maven, and is free and easy to use.
The plugin is still under development, so a lot of features are still in progress.

## Commands

For now the plugin does not have any commands, but we expect soon to add commands for administrators.
Think in the spirit like easy format changing without needing to reload the plugin and other neat features.

## Permissions

At this current build are no permissions or any requirements for users to be able to use this, 
so if you have a larger server and are you reliable on permissions, I will ask you to wait with using this plugin.

## Documentation

As for this, this will come as soon as possible!
